Example of Structured History Output
========================================

When the API processes clinical notes, the "history" field will be formatted like this for quick doctor review:

CHRONIC CONDITIONS:
• Type 2 Diabetes - ongoing management required
• Hypertension - under control with medication

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
• Metformin 850mg 2x/day (365 days) - for diabetes management
• Ciprofloxacin 500mg 2x/day (6 days) - for current UTI infection
• Paracetamol 1g 2x/day (3 days) - pain management

ALLERGIES & WARNINGS:
• Ciprofloxacin may affect blood sugar levels in diabetic patients
• Potential interaction: Ciprofloxacin + Metformin - monitor closely
• Paracetamol - avoid exceeding dose to prevent liver damage

RECENT MEDICAL HISTORY:
• Current complaint: Burning urination, lower abdominal pain, fatigue
• Previous diagnosis: Urinary tract infection (UTI)
• Suprapubic tenderness noted, signs of dehydration

RISK FLAGS:
• Chronic condition: Type 2 Diabetes increases infection risk
• Higher risk of infection complications
• Blood sugar may fluctuate during antibiotic therapy
• Monitor kidney function due to Metformin + Ciprofloxacin interaction

========================================
This format allows doctors to:
- Scan quickly for critical information
- Spot potential drug interactions immediately
